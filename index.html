            <h5>WELCOME TO D-MMEP 2021!</h5>

            <p class="lead">
                The D-MMEP'21 workshop is scheduled on July 7th, 2021 (Tentative) and will be held at Washington DC, USA.
            </p>

            <p> The D-MMEP'21 workshop is co-located with 
                <a href="https://icdcs2021.us/"> the Forty First IEEE International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems (ICDCS 2021)</a>.</p>

            <p> The objective of this workshop is to present and discuss recent trends in multimedia event processing. Event processing is an effective way to disseminate information to the intended user as they are open, distributed, and decoupled. Traditionally, the event processing domain was focused on processing IoT scalar data. With the advancement in the Internet of Multimedia Things (IoMT), there is a significant shift in the data landscape. Visual sensors such as CCTV, smartphones are now ubiquitous and generating a huge amount of multimedia data such as images and videos. Deep learning has become one of the widely adopted techniques to process multimedia content and has achieved success in the development of novel applications such as video and image analytics. Deep learning models come with performance bottlenecks as they require enormous computing resources and training data to process multimedia data. Heterogeneity of computing resources, resource intensiveness and unstructured data model are some of the biggest challenges of processing multimedia content in event processing domains. </p>  


                <p>This workshop aims to bridge the gap to perform event processing by adopting the latest AI/ML techniques to process multimedia content and complements with the ongoing work in the distributed systems community. The workshop calls on novel ideas, tools, techniques, datasets, and experiments in the field of multimedia event processing. Topics of interest include but are not limited to:</p>
