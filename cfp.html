            <p>The objective of D-MMEP workshop is to present and discuss recent trends in multimedia event processing.</p>

            <p>Event processing is an effective way to disseminate information to the intended user as they are open, distributed, and decoupled. Traditionally, the event processing domain was focused on processing IoT scalar data. With the advancement in the Internet of Multimedia Things (IoMT), there is a significant shift in the data landscape. Visual sensors such as CCTV, smartphones are now ubiquitous and generating a huge amount of multimedia data such as images and videos. Deep learning has become one of the widely adopted techniques to process multimedia content and has achieved success in the development of novel applications such as video and image analytics. Deep learning models come with performance bottlenecks as they require enormous computing resources and training data to process multimedia data. Heterogeneity of computing resources, resource intensiveness and unstructured data model are some of the biggest challenges of processing multimedia content in event processing domains.</p>

            <p>This workshop aims to bridge the gap to perform event processing by adopting the latest AI/ML techniques to process multimedia content and complements with the ongoing work in the distributed systems community. The workshop calls on novel ideas, tools, techniques, datasets, and experiments in the field of multimedia event processing. Topics of interest include but are not limited to:</p>

            <p>Papers describing timely research contributions in D-MMEP areas of interest are solicited. Papers reporting
                on initial results as well as papers discussing mature research projects or case studies of deployed systems
                are sought out. Submissions describing big ideas that may have significant impact and could lead to interesting
                discussions at the workshop are encouraged. </p>

            <p>All papers need to be submitted electronically in PDF format through <b>submission link</b> hosted with EasyChair. Papers must be formatted for 8.5x11-inch paper. The length of the paper must be no more than 6 pages (or 8 pages with over-length charge) in the IEEE double-column format (10-pt font), including references and everything. The reviews will be single-blind. Each paper will be assigned to at least 3 reviewers from the related fields to access the work. At least one of the authors of every accepted paper must register and present the paper at the worksho</p>
